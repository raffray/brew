make "vbr fix" part of Wipe function?

list processing...

in case of backup, if there is a fail... we quit?

*** DOING
** re-factoring frame/frameList
   * changing names into frame.c --> id3v2_frame.c
   * using the generic_list model to push frames into a linked list
   * storing the strings into frame-types instead of using offset from file

   * redispatch set_/get_ functions
   * rename get_tag_... into get_id3v2Tag_...

   * TXXX frames with '00' in the middle of string????
   * APIC frames... we need to make sure all strings are compatible for renaming
   *  same for file renaming. some characters are forbiden.

   * Frames and tag flags
     in case of nsynchronisation
     all "FF 00" to be replaced by FF ????? at least in picture data in APIC frame
         %11111111 00000000 111xxxxx  should be reverted back to  %11111111 111xxxxx

   * restore, "SELECT" mode, if no frame is dumped we should not even dump the tag Header!!!!!
     I don't like the way the frame dumping is done.
     Better dump the tag in a buffer (max-size == size of original tag)
	 and then dump buffer.

	* Add error-code system

** DONE
** rename function **
   removing the TYER field; useless for compilations where tracks of same album have different year
